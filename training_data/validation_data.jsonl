business and entertainment, and we are a go-to destination for football and sports fans. everything we do is driven by our core mission, to support and promote credible and independent public interest journalism. we want to change the way people read the news, getting them to adopt a healthy news diet by reading widely outside their comfort zone, and we want to foster and support news that is written in the public interest, by publishers who are free, independent and well-supported. we believe that news is an essential element of a democratic society, and we want to play a role in making

{"id":210,"text":"about us diamond light source is the uk’s national synchrotron; a huge scientific facility designed to produce very intense beams of x-rays, infrared, and ultraviolet light. our scientists use the light to study a vast range of subject matter, from new medicines and treatments for disease to innovative engineering and cutting-edge technology. at diamond we are currently planning a major upgrade of the facility, known as diamond-ii. diamond-ii will combine a new machine and new experimental labs, known as beamlines, with a comprehensive series of upgrades to optics, detectors, sample environments, sample delivery capabilities and computing, which will ultimately generate an even more brilliant light source at a higher energy. about the role we now have an opportunity for a software engineer within the diamond data acquisition (daq) group to develop the next generation data acquisition software used for orchestrating experiments at diamond. the daq group develops software to interface with and control the hardware which allows experiments to be performed and monitored as well as guiding the end user to tools for data reduction and analysis. the group works closely with scientists, motion, and controls engineers to continuously develop and improve software solutions for scientific data acquisition and on-the-fly monitoring and data analysis. typical experiments will generate tens of terabytes of data per day. experimental data is currently acquired with our open-source software package, gda, which is responsible for managing and executing experiments, capture and storage of experimental data and real-time visualisation of collected data. gda is a client-server application written in java, making use of the eclipse rcp framework. the gda server communicates with beamline hardware via epics to provide a control and monitor capability and deliver high-level experimental functions. a gda client provides both a gui and a python scripting capability for users to control experiments locally. to facilitate the advanced scientific capabilities that are expected from diamond-ii the data acquisition software is being modernised and will result in a more service-based architecture. the new acquisition platform, athena, will be configured to deliver advanced capabilities for a new collection of state-of-the-art flagship beamlines. as a software engineer in the daq group you will work alongside other software engineers contributing to the generic daq software modernisation and developing specialised diamond-ii flagship beamline daq solutions in an open and collaborative environment. you will be required to interact with scientists and translate their specifications for scientific capabilities into software requirements. you will liaise with controls and motions engineers to put these requirements into action. you will also potentially participate in international collaborations within this domain, sharing best practice and supporting other facilities and synchrotrons within the collaboration. this role will play a significant part in contributing to the diamond-ii upgrade. about you you will be qualified to degree level in a stem subject, with experience in the full software development lifecycle, using a modern high-level language, and with an understanding of good software design principles and design for usability. experience of working with large and complex code bases would be a distinct advantage, as would experience of python 3, java, spring, jms message-oriented middleware, java rmi, the hdf5 file format, the eclipse rcp platform, rest and kubernetes. you should display good communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, with personal interest or experience in a science environment. benefits diamond offers an exceptional benefits package to support staff in achieving a positive work\/life balance. this includes 26 days annual leave plus christmas closure, public holidays, 2 annual volunteering days and flexible working hours. we also offer an excellent defined benefit pension scheme. staff also have access to a range of amenities on
